# fastcgi-rs
A Rust implementation of the FastCGI process control specification.

In theory, this library is agnostic to the particular application. However, in practise, it is tailored to work with PHP's implementation.

This library mainly follows the specification [here](https://fastcgi-archives.github.io/FastCGI_Specification.html).
